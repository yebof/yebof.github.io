Since its founding in 2018, the University Blockchain Research Initiative (UBRI) has supported hundreds of research projects across the globe. It was my honor to scan through hundreds of research papers generated from UBRI partners and put together a report to highlight the BEST blockchain research.

Check out the ***[2021 UBRI report](https://ripple.com/files/RippleImpact-UBRI-Research-2021.pdf)*** ! It analyzes projects from the past year and highlights breakthrough academic contributions supported by this initiative, from security to policy to social good.
