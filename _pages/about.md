I am a research fellow at the Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore. I am working with [Prof. Liu, Yang](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/yangliu/) on computer security and privacy. Before joining NTU, I received my Ph.D. degree from the [Computer Science Department](https://cs.uoregon.edu/) at the University of Oregon (UO), where I conducted my research in the [Center for Cyber Security and Privacy (CCSP)](https://ccsp.uoregon.edu/).

My research interests include network security, network traffic analysis, blockchain security, decentralized finance (DeFi), DDoS defense, and machine learning for security.

I am the recipient of the Best Paper Award of 2019 IEEE CNS, Gurdeep Pall Graduate Student Fellowship of UO, and Ripple Research Fellowship. I have served as the reviewer of IEEE TDSC, IEEE TIFS, IEEE JSAC, ACM TKDD, etc. I was on the program committees of several international conferences, such as CIKM, CYBER, SECURWARE, etc. I was also on the AE committees of USENIX OSDI and USENIX ATC.
